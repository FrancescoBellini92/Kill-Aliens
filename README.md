# Kill Aliens

A simple clone of Space Invaders, built with Pygame.

This comes from my early days of programming so, even after a recent refactoring, it's not very polished. Still, I had quite some fun developing this.

## How to run

1) Install Python 3
2) Clone the repo
3) Install required dependencies via "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
4) Execute Kill_Aliens.pyw
